            Plants are important for several reasons, especially in modern times when people spend more time indoors due to work and lifestyle changes. They provide us with a variety of things to fulfil our daily requirements, including food to eat, air to breathe, clothes to cover our body, wood, medicine, shelter, and many products for human benefit. Plants are the primary producers, and all other living organisms on this planet depend on plants.Plants are important for several reasons, especially in modern times when people spend more time indoors due to work and lifestyle changes.
