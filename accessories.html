<h2>Gardening Accessories  : </h2>

<p>Gardening accessories or tools are amongst several instruments explicitly made for horticulture and agriculture, well-classified into 'power tools' and 'hand tools'.

  The most common garden accessory used by gardeners is the hoe. It is a broad-toothed gardening tool whose primary function is to dig and excavate the soil.
  
  The 'gardener's pick', or fork, is another useful garden accessory, used to plant seedlings and take care of them in the growing season.
  
  To control weeds, gardeners use a trimmer, a small tool that has a narrow blade used to shred leaves, stems and even roots from plants.
  
  These become super important if you are serious about creating a healthy garden. They save you time and give you results.
