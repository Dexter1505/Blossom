            Plants are important for several reasons, especially in modern times when people spend more time indoors due to work and lifestyle changes. They provide us with a variety of things to fulfil our daily requirements, including food to eat, air to breathe, clothes to cover our body, wood, medicine, shelter, and many products for human benefit. Plants are the primary producers, and all other living organisms on this planet depend on plants.

 <li>Packaging was great and though few leaves fell... Overall as you can see it in the picture it is beautiful. Worth it - <b>Neeta Singh</b></li>
<li>It’s worth the money. Plant received in a very good condition. Growing well, picture is one week after delivery - <b>Jaya Chabbra</b></li>
<li>So to start with firstly I was little skeptic about buying plant online ,But I dared nd ordrd it , It was a gud purchase, Healthy plant nd with good price . I would rather buy a green live plant 100rs expensive then artificial one. So if u wish to buy u must go for it . Low maintenance bamboo plant is awesome. I had kept it on my work table in it gives a really good feel - <b>Shobha Deol</b></li>
<li>Plant received in good condition however self watering pot is small, you need to get another big pot as tree grows. -<b> Amrita Sen</b></li>
