        They provide us with a variety of things

        including food to eat, air to breathe,
        clothes to cover our body, wood, medicine,
        shelter,and many products for human benefit.
        Plants are the primary producers,

 <li>Packaging was great and though few leaves fell... Overall as you can see it in the picture it is beautiful. Worth it - <b>Neeta Singh</b></li>
<li>It’s worth the money. Plant received in a very good condition. Growing well, picture is one week after delivery - <b>Jaya Chabbra</b></li>
<li>So to start with firstly I was little skeptic about buying plant online ,But I dared nd ordrd it , It was a gud purchase, Healthy plant nd with good price . I would rather buy a green live plant 100rs expensive then artificial one. So if u wish to buy u must go for it . Low maintenance bamboo plant is awesome. I had kept it on my work table in it gives a really good feel - <b>Shobha Deol</b></li>
<li>Plant received in good condition however self watering pot is small, you need to get another big pot as tree grows. -<b> Amrita Sen</b></li>
