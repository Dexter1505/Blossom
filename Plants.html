 <u><big>Indoor Plants</big></u>
 <p>
  In recent years, the popularity of indoor home plants has skyrocketed, and for good reason. These natural wonders not only add beauty and tranquility to your living space but also provide a range of benefits that contribute to your overall well-being.
  <br>
  “We see a clear connection with the fact that being around plants improves cortisol levels in our body,” says Melinda Knuth, an assistant professor of horticultural science at North Carolina State University. “We hold our stress hormone, cortisol, in our saliva, and we know this is decreased when we’re around plants.”

 </p>
 <br>

 <u><big>Air Purifying Plants</big></u>
 <p>
  The right to clean air is a fundamental right. Yet we rarely ever get to breathe clean air, especially in cities. Now, buying an air purifier to clean our ambient air seems like the only wise option.
  But air-purifiers are expensive. So, what does one do?
  Invest in houseplants.
  <br>
  Not only do they Jazz up your home but clean the toxins from the air simultaneously too. That’s a win-win situation too. Isn’t it?
 </p>
 <br>
 <br>

 </p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <u><big>Cacti and Succulents</big></u>
 <p>
  The plant helps cleans the air and improves breathing. Carbon dioxide is absorbed by all plants, including the cactus, and converted into breathing oxygen. Furthermore, the cactus removes pollutants from the interior air, assisting in improving indoor air quality.
  <br>
  Succulents soaks the gases which you shouldn't breathe – ammonia and benzene. The same happens with the succulent plants, moistens the air, and improves the air quality much more than the other plants. Succulents like snake plants and aloe are the most famous plants for removing toxins from the air.
 </p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <u><big>Hanging Plants</big></u>
 <p>
  Make crowded shelves and tabletops a thing of the past by hanging your houseplants from your ceilings and walls. The following varieties and their trailing stems, dangling leaves, and gracefully arching shapes will make the best use of your home's vertical spaces.
 </p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <u><big>Medicinals and Aromatic Plants</big></u>
 <p>
  Medicinal & Aromatic Plants (MAPs) are botanical raw materials, also known as herbal drugs that are mostly utilized for therapeutic, aromatic and/or culinary purposes as components of cosmetics, health, medicinal products and other natural health products.
 </p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <u><big>Fruit Plants</big></u>

 <li>So to start with firstly I was little skeptic about buying plant online ,But I dared nd ordrd it , It was a gud purchase, Healthy plant nd with good price . I would rather buy a green live plant 100rs expensive then artificial one. So if u wish to buy u must go for it . Low maintenance bamboo plant is awesome. I had kept it on my work table in it gives a really good feel - <b>Shobha Deol</b></li>
 <li>Plant received in good condition however self watering pot is small, you need to get another big pot as tree grows. -<b> Amrita Sen</b></li>
